## 3. CURRENT STAGE

Stage:
C.7.5 (Liquidity & Cash-Flow Stress Engine)

Objective:
Author Architecture Plan in `docs/C7_5_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` covering 4-tier liquidity horizon decomposition (T0, T2_T3, T4_T7, LOCKED_ILLIQUID, UNKNOWN), precedence resolution contract, liquidity haircut modeling (No Haircut, Moderate, Severe), recurring cash-flow & emergency runway modeling against essential survival burn, 4-scenario deterministic stress matrix (Base, Income Shock, Portfolio Haircut, Combined Severe Stress), lockup / ELSS / maturity schedule breakdown, bottleneck diagnostics, composite liquidity stress score (0-100) and tiers (HEALTHY, WATCH, STRESSED, CRITICAL), versioned policy `C7_5_V1`, and 42-scenario acceptance matrix.

Architecture Gate:
PROPOSED — PENDING GATE REVIEW (Zero-Code Gate Active 🔒)

Implementation:
LOCKED (Zero-Code Gate Active 🔒)

Certified Baseline:
578040f
