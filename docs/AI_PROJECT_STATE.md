## 3. CURRENT STAGE

Stage:
C.7.6 (Scenario & Stress-Test Engine)

Objective:
Architectural remediation for Stage C.7.6 Scenario & Stress-Test Engine (`docs/C7_6_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` Version 2.1.0). Addressed final findings:
1. `C7.6-R17`: Monotonic Downside Reverse-Stress Solver ($s_i^{\text{downside}} = \min(0, R_S(c(i))\beta_i)$ ensuring $\frac{dL_p}{d\lambda} \ge 0$ for proven bisection convergence).
2. Cleaned up solver state machine (`ZERO_TARGET`, `INVALID_TARGET`, `SOLVED`, `UNREACHABLE_WITHIN_BOUNDS`).
3. DTO beta source cleanup (retained `AUTHORITATIVE_METADATA` and `DEFAULT_UNIT_BETA`).
4. Clarified CASH treatment (delegated to C.7.5 without mutating canonical 8-class taxonomy).

Implementation Status:
GATE LOCKED 🔒 (Zero-Code Gate Active)
